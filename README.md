# IMDB-Movie-Scoring-Sorting

# Business Problem
- The film lists are requested to be updated by sorting the movies according to their current scores and ratings listed on the IMDb page.

# Data Story
- The dataset consists of various features related to movies found on the IMDb page, such as "title", "vote_average" and "vote_count".
We will use the variables "title", "vote_average" and "vote_count" in this dataset.

- title: Name of the movie
- vote_average: Average score of the movie (between 1 - 10)
- vote_count: Number of people scoring
